# ft_printf

This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. Hopefully you will be able to reuse it in future project without the fear of being flagged as a cheater. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions in C.
The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code
